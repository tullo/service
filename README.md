The service starter kit is a starting point for building production grade scalable web service applications. The goal of this project is to provide a proven starting point that reduces the repetitive tasks required for a new project to be launched into production.

Deployment manifests are versioned in a separate [repository](https://github.com/tullo/service-deployment).
